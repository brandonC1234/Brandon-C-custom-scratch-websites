## User Instructrions
The teacher must first open the website. It will then prompt her with a password, which is "elephant" by default. She will then enter in her name.
The students can now join. It will prompt them for their name.
**Sutdents must click the leave game button to leave, closing the tab will break everything**
If this does happen, have everyone leave and start from beginning of instructions
Once the students have joined, the teacher will select the difficulty parameters by selecting desired operators, a starting difficulty number, a difficultly multiplier (speeds up difficulty), and a difficulty divisor (reduces speed at which difficulty increases).
The teacher will then click click "Deploy Equations"
It will take a second for the student devices to confirm the deploy
Once all the student devices have confirmed, the teacher can click "start round"
They will be prompted to enter a round and question timer
The students will now have an equation pop up on their screen
They simply type in the answer (including negative signs) and press answer to submit
Every correct answer will gain them a point, but a wrong answer will put them out for the rest of the round
At the end of the round or when the student messes up, their score will update for everyone
This concludes a round and the teacher can start a new one.
