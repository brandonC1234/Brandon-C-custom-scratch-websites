## Overview
This is a website I made for my 10th grade biology class that enabled students to enter in an RNA sequence and it would convert it to text for an activity. It also has the option to enter in a statement and translate this to an encoded RNA sequence. It also has the functions of simulating the effects of substitution, deletion, and insertion on the message. It's last function is to convert an DNA sequence to the corresponding RNA sequence
