## Overview
This is a website I made for my 10th grade biology class that enabled students to enter in an RNA sequence and it would convert it to text for an activity. It also has the option to enter in a statement and translate this to an encoded RNA sequence. It also has the functions of simulating the effects of substitution, deletion, and insertion on the message. It's last function is to convert an DNA sequence to the corresponding RNA sequence

## User Instructrions
#### Decoding RNA sequences
1. enter in the RNA sequence to the input
2. Click decode
3. program will identify any invalid letters and print out where they are
4. if there are no invlid letters, code will display the converted text with "stop" indicating a space

#### Converting DNA sequences to RNA sequences
1. enter in the DNA sequence using the correct DNA letters
2. Click convert
3. program will identify any bad letters and print out where they are
4. if there are no invalid letters, the code will display the converted RNA sequence

#### Encoding text messages
1. enter in the message you would like to encode
2. Click encode
3. program will identify any bad letters and print out where they are
4. if there are no invalid letters, the code will display the encoded RNA sequence

#### Simulating deletion, insertion, and substitution
1. enter in the RNA sequence you would like to decode with the simulated change
2. Click the button corresponding to the simulated mutation you want (deletion, insertion, or substitution)
3. program will identify any bad letters and print out where they are
4. if there are no invalid letters, the code will print the orginal converted text below
5. it will then edit the sequence according to the chosen mutation and display the conversion of the edited sequence

## Recreation Instructions
1. Should transfer easily
## Special aspects
1. This code was not at all required and I went very above and beyond with all the functionality
